Required Tasks




 


Stretch Tasks

 Consider any stretch tasks from last week's project that you did not attempt.
 Keep track of the cleanliness of individual pets' cages and offer an option 
 in the user interface to clean pet cages
 DNA! In order to give your pets individual character,
 include as part of each pet's state one or more multipliers
 for needs so that one pet may become hungrier/thirstier/more bored slower/faster 
 than another pet. (Tip: you could create a class to encapsulate this.)
